# Lox Interpreter in C++

This is a C++ implementation of Crafting Interpreters by Bob Nystrom, created as a personal project in my free time. The goal is to learn fundamental computer science concepts, C++ programming, and build a small, working interpreter.

## Features

Lexer / Scanner

Parser and AST construction

Tree-walking interpreter

REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)

## Purpose

This project is primarily a learning exercise to:

Practice C++ programming, including classes and memory management

Understand interpreters and language implementation

Apply CS fundamentals in a small, manageable project

## Usage

Compile the project using your preferred C++ compiler (C++17 recommended).

Run the executable to start the REPL.

Enter expressions and statements to see them evaluated.
